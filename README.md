# Trigon.io

Hello there!

You may remember Trigon.io, which was released early 2017. It has been recently discontinued, so I have decided to post its source code here. This is from a while ago, so my coding style is a bit of a mess. I also hadn't started using Git, so all the previous versions are backed up in folders.

I'm not expecting anyone to run it, but if you do, let me know. I can also help you with any issues getting it running.
